# kerororpgen
The unofficial translation of Keroro RPG!


## Notes
The Tutorial is currently UNTRANSLATED (I'm working on it, I promise! just having trouble finding/opening it) Below are the controls:

In Semi-Auto Mode press Y+Up to jump

Press A to attack

Press Y to guard

In Semi-Auto Mode, your character will automatically close-in to attack the enemy when pressing A

The CC Guage (Above your character Icon/health) is used for attacks, normal attacks deplete the Guage by 1, stronger attacks deplete it further, standing still or guarding fills the guage.
